# Contributing

First off, thank you for your interest in contributing. I am always
interested in bug reports and pull requests to fix them.
For the time being, I am not looking for help in implementing
features. Feel free to report feature requests as issues.

## Style

I aim to comply with PEP 8, except indent with 2 spaces.
